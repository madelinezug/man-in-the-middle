I spent 16 hours on this assignment. I really enjoyed the process of setting up the sockets and implementing encryption. It was a much longer and larger project than I expected since each of the components took significant time to test and debug. By the end there were still many changes and improvements I wanted to make. I think it would have been really helpful to have a partner. Maybe in the future this assignment could span two weeks? Or provide some socket starter code. Although that would take out some of the learning that I enjoyed.
